# Advent of Code 2020

I started this repository so that a co-worker and I could share and collaborate on our solutions to the Advent of Code 2020!

**DISCLAIMER: I lost the first 4 days of work due to an unfortunate git-cident...**

## Getting Started

I am using the following tools for this:

- Ruby v2.7.2
- Bundle
- Rspec
- Standardrb

### Running the tests

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rspec
```

# Prettying up the code

```
$ bundle exec standardrb --fix
```
